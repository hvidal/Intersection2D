# Intersection 2D #

This C++ code finds the intersection of two shapes in two dimensions. The intersection is the region of overlap between the two shapes. This project was inspired by exercise 3.8.1 (3) of the book "Mathematical Structures for Computer Graphics" by Steven J. Janke, but the code does more than the exercise requires. 

The code takes two sets of points that describe the two shapes. The angle between two consecutive edges must be less than 180 degrees (PI). 

The code outputs the region of overlap as a set of points in counterclockwise order.

I've used test-driven development and this technique has helped a lot (as always).

### How do I get set up? ###

You can download the code and run the compile.sh script available in the source folder.
